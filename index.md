# Marielle Soniat Pointer

I am interested in using data science and machine learning to drive development of new technologies based on 
novel scientific discoveries. My previous research was in computational physical chemistry including reaction-
diffusion models and molecular dynamics. I enjoy collaborating with a diverse team on intellectually stimulating
problems.
