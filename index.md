# Marielle Soniat Pointer

I am interested in using data science and machine learning to drive development of new technologies based on 
novel scientific discoveries. My previous research was in computational physical chemistry including reaction-
diffusion models and molecular dynamics. I enjoy collaborating with a diverse team on intellectually stimulating
problems. 

### Data Science Portfolio:
1. [Rate Neighborhoods based on User Preferences](https://mariellesp.github.io/Rate-Neighborhoods/)   
         <img src="ratings02.PNG" align="right" width="200">
   Completed as a capstone project for the IBM Data Science Professional Certificate. The preferences in neighborhood features for two users are given. Each neighborhood in New Orleans, LA, USA is evalated based on the number of desired venue types in Foursquare. A personalized score for each neighborhood is generated.
